## Quickstart

### Installing Codex with Speckit Support (Required)

To use the Specify/Speckit commands, you must build Codex from this repository:

1.  **Install Rust:** If you haven't already, install Rust via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0xhalil/codex.git
    cd codex
    ```
3.  **Build and Install:**
    ```bash
    cargo install --path codex-cli
    ```
    This will compile Codex and install the `codex` binary to your `~/.cargo/bin` directory.

4.  **Run:**
    Run the binary directly to ensure you are using the version with Speckit support:
    ```bash
    ~/.cargo/bin/codex
    ```
    (Or simply `codex` if `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH.)

### Official Release (Legacy/Public)

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).

## Specify (Speckit) Integration

Codex now supports Speckit commands natively within the TUI. This allows you to load project-specific context and prompts directly from your project's configuration.

### How to use

1.  **Initialize Project:**
    To enable Specify commands, initialize Speckit in your project directory targeting the Codex agent structure:
    ```bash
    npx speckit init --agent codex
    ```
    This creates the necessary `.codex/prompts/` directory with standard templates.

2.  **Run Codex:**
    Run the binary directly to ensure you are using the version with Speckit support:
    ```bash
    ~/.cargo/bin/codex
    ```
    (Or simply `codex` if `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH.)

3.  **Use Commands:**
    *   Type `/specify.` in the input box to see a list of available Specify commands.
    *   You can also type the command name directly (e.g., `/plan`, `/constitution`) to find and execute them.

> **Note:** Codex prioritizes configuration in `.codex/prompts/` over legacy `.gemini/commands/` directories.
